      <h2>Originated: Britain</h2>
      <p>
        English is a West Germanic language that originated from Anglo-Frisian
        languages brought to Britain in the mid 5th to 7th centuries AD by
        Anglo-Saxon migrants from what is now northwest Germany, southern
        Denmark and the Netherlands.
      </p>
      <h2>Created by: Anglo-Saxon migrants</h2>
      <p>
        The Anglo-Saxons settled in the British Isles from the mid-5th century
        and came to dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain. Their language,
        now called Old English, originated as a group of Anglo-Frisian languages
        which were spoken, at least by the settlers, in England and southern and
        eastern Scotland in the early Middle Ages, displacing the Celtic
        languages (and, possibly, British Latin) that had previously been
        dominant. Old English reflected the varied origins of the Anglo-Saxon
        kingdoms established in different parts of Britain.
      </p>
      <h2>Originated in: 5th Century</h2>
      <h2>Oldest English Words: 'I', 'we', 'who', 'one', 'two', 'three'</h2>
      <p>
        According to a 2009 study by researchers at Reading University, the
        oldest words in the English language include “I“, “we“, “who“, “two” and
        “three“, all of which date back tens of thousands of years.
      </p>
      <h2>English Grammer Originated: Late Sixteenth Century</h2>
      <p>
        The English language was first used in the late sixteenth century, when
        the Englishman John Milton used it to describe the weather in England.
      </p>
      <h2>First use of English Language</h2>
      <p>
        The English language was first used in the early Middle Ages, when the
        Englishman John Milton used it to describe the weather in England.
      </p>

      <h2>Who wrote English Grammer?</h2>
      <p>
        The first English grammar, Pamphlet for Grammar by William Bullokar,
        written with the seeming goal of demonstrating that English was quite as
        rule-bound as Latin, was published in 1586. Bullokar's grammar was
        faithfully modeled on William Lily's Latin grammar, Rudimenta
        Grammatices (1534).
      </p>
      <h3>
        English as we know it today came to be exported to other parts of the
        world through British colonisation, and is now the dominant language in
        Britain and Ireland, the United States and Canada, Australia, New
        Zealand and many smaller former colonies, as well as being widely spoken
        in India, parts of Africa, and elsewhere. Partially due to influence of
        the United States and its globalized efforts of commerce and technology,
        English took on the status of a global lingua franca in the second half
        of the 20th century. This is especially true in Europe, where English
        has largely taken over the former roles of French and (much earlier)
        Latin as a common language used to conduct business and diplomacy, share
        scientific and technological information, and otherwise communicate
        across national boundaries. The efforts of English-speaking Christian
        missionaries have resulted in English becoming a second language for
        many other groups.
