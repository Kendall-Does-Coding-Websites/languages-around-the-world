      <h2>How did Hindi start?</h2>
      <p>
        Modern standard Hindi evolved from the interaction of early speakers of
        Khari Boli with Muslim invaders from Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Central
        Asia, and elsewhere. As the new immigrants settled and began to adjust
        to the Indian social environment, their languages—which were ultimately
        lost—enriched Khari Boli.

      <h2>Who created Hindi?</h2>
      <p>
        Like other Indo Aryan languages , Hindi is the direct descendant of
        early form of vedic Sanskrit . It emerged in 7th century A.D. It is not
        invented by anybody.

      <h2>How did Hindi evolve?</h2>
      <p>
        Hindi is a language that has been spoken in India for thousands of
        years. It is the second most spoken language in India.

      <h3>
        Hindi is an Indo-Aryan language spoken chiefly in the northern part of
        India. Hindi has been described as a standardised and Sanskritised
        register of the Hindustani language, which itself is based primarily on
        the Khariboli dialect of Delhi and neighbouring areas of Northern India.
        Hindi, written in the Devanagari script, is one of the two official
        languages of the Government of India, along with English. It is an
        official language in 9 States and 3 Union Territories and an additional
        official language in 3 other states. Hindi is also one of the 22
        scheduled languages of the Republic of India. Hindi is the lingua franca
        of the Hindi Belt. It is also spoken, to a lesser extent, in other parts
        of India (usually in a simplified or pidginised variety such as Bazaar
        Hindustani or Haflong Hindi). Outside India, several other languages are
        recognised officially as "Hindi" but do not refer to the Standard Hindi
        language described here and instead descend from other dialects, such as
        Awadhi and Bhojpuri. Such languages include Fiji Hindi, which is
        official in Fiji, and Caribbean Hindustani, which is spoken in Trinidad
        and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. Apart from the script and formal
        vocabulary, standard Hindi is mutually intelligible with standard Urdu,
        another recognised register of Hindustani as both share a common
        colloquial base. As a linguistic variety, Hindi is the fourth
        most-spoken first language in the world, after Mandarin, Spanish and
        English. Hindi alongside Urdu as Hindustani is the third most-spoken
        language in the world, after Mandarin and English.
