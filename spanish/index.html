      <h2>Originated: Iberian Peninsula</h2>
      <p>
        Spanish originated in the Iberian Peninsula as a dialect of spoken
        Latin, which is today called “Vulgar Latin,” as opposed to the Classical
        Latin used in literature. The dialect of Spanish that we consider
        dominant in Europe is called Castellano or Castilian Spanish.
      </p>
      <h2>Derived by: Latin</h2>
      <p>
        The language known today as Spanish is derived from a dialect of spoken
        Latin, which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans after
        their occupation of the peninsula that started in the late 3rd century
        BC.
      </p>
      <h2>Originated in: 13th Century</h2>
      <p>
        Most scholars agree that modern Spanish was established in a standard
        written form in the 13th century in the Kingdom of Castile in the
        Spanish city of Toledo.
      </p>
      <h2>First countries to speak Spanish: Present-day Spain and Portugal</h2>
      <p>
        It originated on the Iberian Peninsula — the southwest corner of Europe
        which includes present-day Spain and Portugal. The Castilian
        continuation of Vulgar Latin (from Spain's Castile region) mixed with
        the Arabic dialect spoken by the Moors, who conquered parts of the
        region.

      <h2>Name of the Language:</h2>
      <p>
        In Spain and in some other parts of the Spanish-speaking world, Spanish
        is called not only español but also castellano (Castilian), the language
        from the kingdom of Castile, contrasting it with other languages spoken
        in Spain such as Galician, Basque, Asturian, Catalan, Aragonese and
        Occitan. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 uses the term castellano to
        define the official language of the whole Spanish State in contrast to
        las demás lenguas españolas (lit. "the other Spanish languages")

      <h3>
        Spanish is a Romance language of the Indo-European language family that
        evolved from colloquial spoken Latin in the Iberian Peninsula. Today, it
        is a global language with nearly 500 million native speakers, mainly in
        the Americas and Spain. It is the world's second-most spoken native
        language after Mandarin Chinese, and the world's fourth-most spoken
        language overall after English, Mandarin Chinese, and Hindi, as well as
        the world's most widely spoken Romance language. Spanish is a part of
        the Ibero-Romance group of languages, which evolved from several
        dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western
        Roman Empire in the 5th century. The oldest Latin texts with traces of
        Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century, and the first
        systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo, a prominent
        city of the Kingdom of Castile, in the 13th century. Modern Spanish was
        then taken to the viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire beginning in 1492,
        most notably to the Americas, as well as territories in Africa and Asia.
        As a Romance language, Spanish is a descendant of Latin and has one of
        the smaller degrees of difference from it (about 20%) alongside
        Sardinian and Italian. Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is
        derived from Latin, including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek.
        Alongside English and French, it is also one of the most taught foreign
        languages throughout the world. Spanish does not feature prominently as
        a scientific language; however, it is better represented in areas like
        humanities and social sciences. Spanish is also the third most used
        language on internet websites after English and Chinese. Spanish is one
        of the six official languages of the United Nations, and it is also used
        as an official language by the European Union, the Organization of
        American States, the Union of South American Nations, the Community of
        Latin American and Caribbean States, the African Union and many other
        international organizations.
