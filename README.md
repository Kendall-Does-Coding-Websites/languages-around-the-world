# languages-around-the-world
Languages Around The World is a project, made by me to share information of many languages around the world.

# Why?
I've always wondered, what are all the languages that exist, how they originated, where they originated, how many people speak the language, etc so I thought of this fun project I can make.

# Where can I check the project out
For now, I'm still working on the project, so I haven't hosted it on any site yet, but when I add atleast 5 languages and their info will be sure to host it. For now, you can check the project out on localhost.
