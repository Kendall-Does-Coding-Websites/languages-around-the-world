# languages-around-the-world
Languages Around The World is a project, made by me to share information of many languages around the world.

# Why?
I've always wondered, what are all the languages that exist, how they originated, where they originated, how many people speak the language, etc so I thought of this fun project I can make.

# Where can I check the project out?
You can check out the project site [here](https://languages.kendalldoescoding.gq).
